# VstoMultiLanguageDemo
Demo project showing VST add-in localization

This is a demo repo for the post that summarizes my experience on translating office add-in to multiple language.
It is not an official guide, but just how you could do it. It assumes you have an office extension (VSTO, desktop) 
in a single language, and want to provide it in some other languages for users in other countries.
